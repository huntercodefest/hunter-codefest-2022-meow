   <p>
      This game contains elements of 2048 and Tetris, with math involved.
   </p>

   <p>
      It is like 2048 in that you use the arrow keys or swipe to merge tiles. The resulting tile's number becomes the
      sum of the 2 tiles' numbers.
   </p>

   <p>
      However, only tiles that fulfill the condition stated on top of the screen can merge. This condition changes every
      time you press an arrow key or swipe.
   </p>

   <p>
      It is also like Tetris in that random tiles fall down. Each cycle, a tile with a random number and color will be
      dropped.
   </p>

   <p>
      Points are awarded for successful merges, with bonus points for consecutive successful merges.
   </p>

   <p>
      The game is over when the random column that a tile is dropping in is already full.
